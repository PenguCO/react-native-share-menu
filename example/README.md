# example

First install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

To run the app on iOS:

* Run `react-native run-ios`, or
* Open `example/ios/ExampleApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode and hit the "Run" button

To run the app on Android:

* Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
* `react-native run-android`
* You may need to run `react-native start` (more information about this [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#troubleshooting-run))
